# Matrix Exercise

- An original from Altar.io, code 0619.
- <a href="https://marcocspereira.github.io/matrix-exercise/" target="_blank">Live demo</a>

This mini-project was developed with Angular 11 that involves creating 2 routes:

- `/generator/`
- `/payments/`

## Requirements

The user should be able to **navigate** between the 2 pages whilst not losing any information i.,e., still see the payments list.

### Generator

- The basic idea is that we have a **10x10** grid filled with characters and will use the host system clock and the grid together to generate a **2 digit code**.

|     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 1   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 2   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 3   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 4   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 5   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 6   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 7   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 8   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |
| 9   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   | a   |

- In this page you have a **button** to start the "_generator_". After clicking on this button the grid will be filled with random alphabetic characters (a-z), like so:

  - Position [0,1] will have a **"b"**;
  - and Position [8,7] will have a **"c"**.

- If you also find an optional **input** field which allows the user to enter an alphabetic character (a-z) and this character will be used as a weight constant of 20% when filling the grid, like so:

  - If a character is entered and it’s a **"z"**, means that 20% of the grid cells will be filled with **“z”** and the remaining ones with random characters.
  - The user is only allowed to enter a character **once every 4 seconds**, i.e. user cannot type repeatedly a random character.

- There is a display field underneath the table with the **2 digit code**.
  To populate this field, the following trivial **algorithm** needs to be followed:

  1.  Get the 2 digit seconds from the clock, like so: `12:40:36`.

  2.  Get the matching grid cell values for the positions [3,6] and [6,3], like so: `"v"` and `"c"`.

  3.  Count the occurrences of `"v"` and `"c"` on the entire grid, like so: `v` = **7**, `c` = **9**.

  4.  If the count is larger than 9, divide the count by the lowest integer possible in order to get a value lower or equal to 9.

  - _roundup the result if decimal_.

  5.  Done! That is your code: **79**

- Every 2 seconds the grid needs to be refreshed and a different code will be generated.

### Payments Page

- In this page you will show the updated **code** on the top (don’t forget, every 2 seconds we have a new code).

- There are 2 simple **form fields** to add a payment name and amount and a **button** to add to the payments list.

- Every entry on the grid will have the current code assigned to it, together with a copy of the grid.

- This payments list should be ready to be saved to an **API**.

## To run local machine

- to run the app: `http://localhost:4200`
- to run the tests: `http://localhost:9876`

### Setup without docker

To run the app:

```shell
$ npm install   # to install
$ npm start     # to run app
$ ng test       # to run tests
```

### Setup with docker

To run the app:

```shell
$ docker-compose up altar_app       # to install and run app
$ docker-compose up altar_test      # to call karma test runner
```

When running `docker-compose up altar_app`, the documentation is created, so it can take some more time than normal.

## Documentation

[Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) is the tool used to generate documentation. If you're running with docker, the documentation step is included in `docker-compose up altar_app`.

If you're running locally, run `npm run compodoc` to generate the most recent documentation.

Anyway, it exists a documentation folder where the [index.html](documentation/index.html) is the main page to study this project documentation. Open in a web browser.
